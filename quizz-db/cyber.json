        "B": "Website defacement<br/>A mirror site may be a website or set of files on a computer server that has been copied to a different computer server in order that the location or files are available from quite one place. A mirror site has its own URL, but is otherwise just like the principal site. Load-balancing devices allow high-volume sites to scale easily, dividing the work between multiple mirror sites. A mirror site is typically updated frequently to make sure it reflects the contents of the first site. In some cases, the first site may arrange for a mirror site at a bigger location with a better speed connection and, perhaps, a better proximity to an outsized audience. If the first site generates an excessive amount of traffic, a mirror site can ensure better availability of the web site or files. For websites that provide copies or updates of widely used software, a mirror site allows the location to handle larger demands and enables the downloaded files to arrive more quickly. Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and other companies have mirror sites from which their browser software are often downloaded. Mirror sites are wont to make site access faster when the first site could also be geographically distant from those accessing it. A mirrored web server is usually located on a special continent from the principal site, allowing users on the brink of the mirror site to urge faster and more reliable access. Mirroring an internet site also can be done to make sure that information are often made available to places where access could also be unreliable or censored. In 2013, when Chinese authorities blocked access to foreign media outlets just like the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, site mirroring was wont to restore access and circumvent government censorship.",
